## 문제
```text
Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

Table: Salaries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's name is missing, or
The employee's salary is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+
Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
WITH MISSING AS (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries)
    UNION
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Salaries
    WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM EMPLOYEES)
)

SELECT *
FROM MISSING
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```

* JOIN에 IS NULL로 풀어도 됐을 것 같긴 한데, 서브쿼리 + CTE 쓴 후에 ORDER BY
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_employees(employees: pd.DataFrame, salaries: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    temp1 = salaries[~salaries['employee_id'].isin(employees['employee_id'])]
    temp2 = employees[~employees['employee_id'].isin(salaries['employee_id'])]
    answer = pd.concat([temp1,temp2])
    return answer[['employee_id']].sort_values('employee_id')
```

* 처음에는 set으로 하나 둬서 풀었는데, isin으로도 안에서 포함유무를 확인할 수 있다는거 확인...
