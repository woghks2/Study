## 문제
```text
Table: RequestAccepted

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
 

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
WITH REQS AS (
    SELECT REQUESTER_ID, COUNT(*) AS NUM
    FROM REQUESTACCEPTED
    GROUP BY REQUESTER_ID
    ),
    ACEPS AS (
    SELECT ACCEPTER_ID, COUNT(*) AS NUM
    FROM REQUESTACCEPTED
    GROUP BY ACCEPTER_ID
    ),
    TEMP AS (
    SELECT REQUESTER_ID AS ID, NUM
    FROM REQS
    UNION ALL
    SELECT ACCEPTER_ID AS ID, NUM
    FROM ACEPS
    )

SELECT ID, SUM(NUM) AS NUM
FROM TEMP
GROUP BY ID
ORDER BY NUM DESC
LIMIT 1
```

* CTE를 통해서 각 사람이 몇 번 요청을 보내고, 몇 번 받았는지 확인하기.
* 풀고보니까 CTE를 여러개 쓸 필요가 없었다.
* 중요한건, UNION을 통해서 유저별 받은 수, 보낸 수를 GROUP BY로 통합해서 계산하기.

```TEXT
| REQUESTER_ID | REQ | ACCEPTER_ID | ACEP |
| ------------ | --- | ----------- | ---- |
| 1            | 2   | null        | null |
| 2            | 1   | 2           | 1    |
| 3            | 1   | 3           | 2    |
```
* 설명
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict as dd

def most_friends(request_accepted: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    
    table = dd(int)
    for _, row in request_accepted.iterrows():
        a, b = row['requester_id'], row['accepter_id']
        table[a] += 1
        table[b] += 1
    
    iden, num = max(table.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

    return pd.DataFrame({'id': [iden], 'num': [num]})
```

* 한 번의 순회로 카운팅을 해주는게 나을거같아서 iterrows로 풀이.
* 다른 추가 연산이 없어서 속도도 다른 코드들에 비해 나쁘지 않은편
