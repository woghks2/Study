```mermaid
erDiagram
    EMPLOYEE {
        int id PK
        varchar name
        int salary
        int departmentId FK
    }
    DEPARTMENT {
        int id PK
        varchar name
    }
    EMPLOYEE ||--|| DEPARTMENT : "departmentId references id"
```

### **목표**

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
-- Solution 1
WITH TEMP AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPARTMENTID ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS SALARY_RANK
    FROM
        EMPLOYEE
)

SELECT
    D.NAME AS DEPARTMENT,
    T.NAME AS EMPLOYEE,
    T.SALARY
FROM
    TEMP T
JOIN
    DEPARTMENT D ON T.DEPARTMENTID = D.ID
WHERE
    SALARY_RANK <= 3
```

* Solution 1: DENSE_RANK + JOIN
  * 이전 문제와 마찬가지로 DENSE RANK + JOIN에 WHERE 조건을 걸어주면 된다.
  * 이게 왜 하드?
  
### **Pandas**
```python
# Solution 1
def top_three_salaries(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employee['salary_rank'] = (employee.groupby('departmentId')['salary']
                                .rank(method='dense',ascending=False))

    cond = employee['salary_rank']<=3
    merged = (pd.merge(employee[cond], department,
                        left_on='departmentId',right_on='id', how='left')
        .rename(columns={'name_y':'Department', 'name_x':'Employee','salary':'Salary'}))                
    return merged[['Department','Employee','Salary']]
```

* Solution 1: rank + merge
  * 가장 큰 값만 찾는게 아니다보니까, agg로 nlargest로 적용하기에는 중복값들로 3개가 채워져서 온전히 구하지 못한다.
