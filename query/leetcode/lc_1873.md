## 문제
```text
Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
Explanation: 
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, IF(EMPLOYEE_ID%2=0 OR SUBSTR(NAME,1,1)='M',0,SALARY) AS BONUS
FROM EMPLOYEES
ORDER BY EMPLOYEE_ID
```

* CASE WHEN보다 IF 내에 OR로 조건걸어서 쓰는게 더 깔끔해보인다.
* AND 대신 OR쓰는게 더 빨라서 OR 사용.
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employees['bonus'] = np.where((employees['employee_id']%2==0) | (employees['name'].str[0] == 'M'), 0, employees['salary'])
    return employees[['employee_id', 'bonus']].sort_values(by='employee_id')
```

* 같은 방식으로 풀이
