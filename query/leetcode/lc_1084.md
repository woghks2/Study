## 문제

Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
Table: Sales

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| buyer_id    | int     |
| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table can have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
 

Write a solution to report the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 4        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | product_name |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | S8           |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
SELECT P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME
FROM PRODUCT AS P
JOIN (
    SELECT PRODUCT_ID, MIN(SALE_DATE) AS MIN_DATE, MAX(SALE_DATE) AS MAX_DATE
    FROM SALES
    GROUP BY PRODUCT_ID) AS T
ON P.PRODUCT_ID = T.PRODUCT_ID
WHERE T.MIN_DATE >= '2019-01-01' AND T.MAX_DATE <= '2019-03-31';
```

* 각 상품의 DATE의 MIN MAX를 구한 후, 이 테이블과 조인한다.
* 이후 날짜만 체크해주면 끝.
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def sales_analysis(product: pd.DataFrame, sales: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    grouped = sales.groupby('product_id').agg(min_date=('sale_date','min'),
                                            max_date=('sale_date','max')).reset_index()

    temp = pd.merge(grouped,product[['product_id','product_name']], on='product_id', how='inner')

    answer = temp[(temp['min_date'] >= '2019-01-01') & (temp['max_date'] <= '2019-03-31')]
    return answer[['product_id','product_name']]
```

* SQL과 같은 방식으로 grouped 테이블을 만들어서 날짜의 최대 최소를 구한다.
* JOIN 시켜준 후, 날짜 체크해주기

### **코멘트**
* agg에 딕셔너리로 전달하기 보다는, 컬럼명을 미리 지정하고 튜플로 전달하는게 더 나은 듯
