## 문제

Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input:  
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
+-------------+

Explanation: 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY < 30000 AND MANAGER_ID IS NOT NULL AND MANAGER_ID NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM EMPLOYEES)
ORDER BY employee_id
```

* 설명
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_employees(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    answer = employees[(employees['salary']<30000) & (~employees['manager_id'].isin(employees['employee_id']))].dropna()
    return answer[['employee_id']].sort_values('employee_id')
```

* 조건 2개 걸어주기.
* 매니저 조건 걸어줄 때 '매니저가 있고 & 떠난' 이라는 복합조건이므로 매니저가 null인 데이터는 볼 필요 없다.
* dropna부터 해주는게 조금 더 빨랐을듯?
  
<br>

### **코멘트**
* 복합 조건을 조금 더 깔끔하게, NOT / AND / OR 빨리 탈출 가능한 방식으로 짜기
