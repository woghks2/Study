Table: Insurance

+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |
+-------------+-------+
pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.
 

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Insurance table:
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
Output: 
+----------+
| tiv_2016 |
+----------+
| 45.00    |
+----------+
Explanation: 
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
WITH A AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM INSURANCE
    WHERE TIV_2015 IN (
        SELECT TIV_2015
        FROM INSURANCE
        GROUP BY TIV_2015
        HAVING COUNT(TIV_2015) > 1)
),
B AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM INSURANCE
    GROUP BY LAT, LON
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)


SELECT ROUND(SUM(A.TIV_2016), 2) AS TIV_2016 
FROM A
JOIN B ON A.PID = B.PID

```

* 각 조건을 만족시키기 위해서 GROUP BY + HAVING을 사용한다.
* 두 개의 CTE를 만든 후 JOIN 연산을 진행하기.
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def find_investments(insurance: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    
    A = insurance.groupby('tiv_2015').size()
    A = A[A>1].index
    A = insurance[insurance['tiv_2015'].isin(A)]
    
    B = insurance.groupby(['lat','lon']).size()
    B = B[B==1].index
    B = insurance.set_index(['lat','lon']).loc[B].reset_index()
    
    result = A.merge(B, on='pid', how='inner',suffixes=('_l','_r'))

    return pd.DataFrame({'tiv_2016': [round(sum(result['tiv_2016_l']),2)]})
```

* groupby + size로 카운팅을 해주고, 조건에 맞게 필터링 해주기.
* 두 테이블을 조인 연산 해주기.
  * python에서는 where같이 조건을 걸었을 때, 기존 테이블이 비어있는 경우 예외처리를 해야돼서 merge를 쓰는게 나은듯.

### **코멘트**
* 불리언 인덱싱 이외에도, index 자체를 이용해서 isin, loc에 필터링이 가능하다.
