## 문제
```text
Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
 

Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL

SELECT PROJECT_ID, ROUND(AVG(EXPERIENCE_YEARS),2) AS AVERAGE_YEARS
FROM (
    SELECT P.PROJECT_ID, E.EXPERIENCE_YEARS
    FROM PROJECT AS P
    JOIN EMPLOYEE AS E ON P.EMPLOYEE_ID = E.EMPLOYEE_ID) AS TEMP
GROUP BY PROJECT_ID
```

* 서브쿼리에서 JOIN을 통해서 PROJECT에 투입된 사람의 연차가 얼마인지 모두 구한다.
* PROJECT별로 GROUP BY + AVG를 진행한다.
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def project_employees_i(project: pd.DataFrame, employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    join = pd.merge(project, employee, on='employee_id')
    answer = join.groupby('project_id').agg({'experience_years': 'mean'}).reset_index()
    answer.rename(columns={'experience_years':'average_years'},inplace=True)
    answer['average_years'] = round(answer['average_years'],2)
    return answer
```

* 같은 방식으로 join을 통해서 project에 투입된 사람의 연차를 모두 매칭시킨다.
* agg를 통해서 평균값을 모두 구해주고 컬럼명, 포매팅 해주면 끝
