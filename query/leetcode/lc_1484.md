## 문제
```text
Table Activities:

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
 

Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
Explanation: 
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**
```SQL
SELECT SELL_DATE,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(PRODUCT)) AS NUM_SOLD,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT PRODUCT ORDER BY PRODUCT SEPARATOR ',') AS PRODUCTS
FROM ACTIVITIES
GROUP BY SELL_DATE;
```

* GROUP_CONCAT이란 함수가 있어서 사용해주면 된다.
* GROUP_CONCAT(합칠 컬럼 정렬기준 SEPARATOR 구분자)
  
### **Pandas**
```python
import pandas as pd

def categorize_products(activities: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    grouped = activities.groupby('sell_date').agg(
        num_sold=('product', 'nunique'),
        products=('product', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))
    ).reset_index()
    return grouped
```

* products=('product', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))
* 이 부분처럼 product 객체 모아놓고, lambda 함수 적용시켜서 반환하기.
* 파이썬으로는 어려울게 없다.
