## 문제

```
Table: Stadium

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
As the id increases, the date increases as well.
 

Write a solution to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive 's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.id

Return the result table ordered by in ascending order.visit_date

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Stadium table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Explanation: 
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.

## 문제 풀이

### **MySQL**

```SQL
WITH CONSECUTIVE AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        SELECT *,
            LAG(PEOPLE) OVER (ORDER BY VISIT_DATE) AS PREV_PEOPLE,
            LEAD(PEOPLE) OVER (ORDER BY VISIT_DATE) AS NEXT_PEOPLE
        FROM STADIUM
        ) AS TEMP
    WHERE PEOPLE >= 100 AND PREV_PEOPLE >= 100 AND NEXT_PEOPLE >= 100
    )

SELECT *
FROM STADIUM
WHERE ID IN (
    SELECT ID FROM CONSECUTIVE
    UNION
    SELECT ID+1 FROM CONSECUTIVE
    UNION
    SELECT ID-1 FROM CONSECUTIVE
)
ORDER BY VISIT_DATE;
```

-   LEAD, LAG로 전행, 다음행이 모두 조건을 만족하는 CTR를 만든다.
-   이 테이블에 있는 ID에 +-  1을 해준 데이터들도 정답이므로 UNION을 통해서 가져오기.

```SQL
with q1 as (
select *, 
     count(*) over( order by id range between current row and 2 following ) following_cnt,
     count(*) over( order by id range between 2 preceding and current row ) preceding_cnt,
     count(*) over( order by id range between 1 preceding and 1 following ) current_cnt
from stadium
where people > 99
)
select id, visit_date, people
from q1
where following_cnt = 3 or preceding_cnt = 3 or current_cnt = 3
order by visit_date
```

-   1등 풀이인데, 자신 포함 위 아래 행이 조건을 만족시키면 카운팅해준다.
-   3개 모두 만족시키는 행만 불러오는 풀이.

### **Pandas**

```PYTHON
import pandas as pd

def human_traffic(stadium: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    stadium['prev_people'] = stadium['people'].shift(1)
    stadium['next_people'] = stadium['people'].shift(-1)

    answer = set()
    for idx, row in stadium.iterrows():
        if pd.notnull(row['people']) and pd.notnull(row['prev_people']) and pd.notnull(row['next_people']) and \
           row['people'] >= 100 and row['prev_people'] >= 100 and row['next_people'] >= 100:
            answer.update((row['id'],row['id']-1,row['id']+1))

    return stadium[stadium['id'].isin(answer)][['id','visit_date','people']]
```

-   한 번 iteration 시키는게 훨씬 나을줄 알았는데 완전 느림...
-   row base가 느리긴 한 듯

### **코멘트**

-   윈도우 함수도 슬슬 익숙해져서 금방 풀린다.
